# textbasedsolitaire
This is a personal student Java project made in IntelliJ IDE

This project is a text based version of the popular card game "Solitaire". Since it is text based some of the formatting slowly gets worse but the
focus of this prject was to get some hands on experience working with things like Arrays/ArrayLists, multipleclasses, and overally getting used to
working on a project from start to finish
