# textbasedsolitaire
This is a personal student Java project made in IntelliJ IDE

This project is a text based version of the popular card game "Solitaire". The focus of this prject was to get some hands on experience working
with things like Arrays/ArrayLists, multipleclasses, and overall getting used to working on a project from start to finish.
However, since it is text based the formatting is not perfect but it was not intended to be.
